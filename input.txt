********** Ending (Isak Danielson) **********

We're at the end of the line
She keeps me from closing my eyes
Keeps me from sleeping at night
Don't let me go


We've been talking awhile
Looking at everything bright
Wrote and she asks me, I'm fine
Just don't let me go


There came a time when you where the only one
You were the only one
The only one


Maybe I could be your only prize
Maybe you would light it wide
Even when I've fallen back
You still believe I tried


Maybe we could be a symphony
And maybe I could learn to play
You could write that story
While I just ride the wave


We're at the end of the line
She keeps me from holding her tight
Trying to make sure she's fine
Don't let me go


We took hundred steps back
How you said goodbye was sad
Now when I think of it add, "please let me go"


There came a time when you were the only one
You were the only one
The only one


Maybe I could be your only prize
Maybe you would light it wide
Even when I've fallen back
You still believe I tried


Maybe we could be a symphony
And maybe I could learn to play
You could ride that story
While I just ride the wave


But life is never like that
But life is never like that
She took me in and now I feel
Still know life's never like that
Life's never like that, life's never like that


Maybe I could be your only prize
Maybe you would light it wide
Even when I've fallen back
You still believe I tried


Maybe we could be a symphony
And maybe I could learn to play
You could write that story
While I just ride the wave


While I just ride the wave




********** Arcade (Duncan Laurence) **********

A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home


I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please carry me, carry me, carry me home


I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game


Oh
Oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game


How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn’t take a lot
I saw the end ‘fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carried on


Oh
Oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game


Oh
Oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game


I don't need your games, game over


Get me off this rollercoaster


Oh
Oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game


Oh
Oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game




********** Long Long Time (Linda Ronstadt) **********

Love will abide
Take things in stride
Sounds like good advice
But there's no one at my side
And time washes clean love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me
But I don't know what it means


'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long long time


Caught in my fears
Blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me
When you never let me near
And I never drew one response from you
All the while you fell all over girls you never knew


'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think it's gonna hurt me
For a long long time


Wait for the day you'll go away
Knowing that you warned me
Of the price I'd have to pay
And life's full of flaws
Who knows the cause?
Living in the memory of a love that never was


'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and change your mind
And I think I'm gonna miss you
For a long long time


'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long long time




********** My Immortal (Evanescence) **********

I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone


These wounds won't seem to heal, this pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase


When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me


You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now, I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away all the sanity in me


These wounds won't seem to heal, this pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase


When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
And you still have all of me


I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me, I've been alone, I'm alone


When you cried, I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream, I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
You still have all of me ah, me ah, me ah




********** Someone Like You (Adele) **********

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light


I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over


Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
"Don't forget me, " I beg
I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"


You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days


I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over


Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
"Don't forget me, " I begged
I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"


Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?


Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
"Don't forget me, " I beg
I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"


Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
"Don't forget me, " I begged
I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
"Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"




********** Stuck (Imagine Dragons) **********

Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Yeah, time goes by and still I am stuck on you, you


I've been afraid, don't wanna fade out of my body
I've been astray, barely awake, floating above me
Covered in grey, what can I say? I've been a zombie
I'm feeling like I've been locked in a grave


You were the laugh, you were the life, you were the party
You were the brave, I was the weak, you were the army
You were the faith, you were the truth, I was the sorry
I'm feeling like you've been taken away


You were my one, you were my one
When all has been said, all has been done
You were my one, you were my one
Now I am left reaching above me, oh-oh


Time goes by and still I am stuck on you, you (oh-oh)
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you, you (oh-oh)


Why did you leave? Why did you go leaving me lonely?
Didn't you know you were the home, you were the only?
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?
Come back to me (oh-oh)


You were my one, you were my one
When all has been said, all has been done (oh-oh)
You were my one, you were my one
Now I am left reaching above me, oh-oh


Time goes by and still I am stuck on you, you (oh-oh)
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you, you (oh-oh)


Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Yeah, time goes by and still I am stuck on you, stuck on you
Ooh, oh-oh-oh
Ooh, oh-oh-oh


As time goes by, as time goes by, whoa (oh-oh)
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you, you (oh-oh)
Time goes by and still I am stuck on you, you (oh-oh)




********** Sweet Creature (Harry Styles) **********

Sweet creature
Had another talk about where it's going wrong
But we're still young
We don't know where we're going
But we know where we belong


And oh we started
Two hearts in one home
It's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn
I know, but oh


Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home


Sweet creature
We're running through the garden
Oh, where nothing bothered us
But we're still young
I always think about you and how we don't speak enough


And oh we started
Two hearts in one home
I know, it's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn
I know, but oh


Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home


I know when we started
Just two hearts in one home
It gets harder when we argue
We're both stubborn
I know, but oh


Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home


You'll bring me home




********** The Night We Met (Lord Huron) **********

I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met


And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you


I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met


When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met


I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met




********** The Scientist (Coldplay) **********

Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart


Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart


Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start


I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart


But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are


Nobody said it was easy
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start




********** True Colours (Tom Odell) **********

You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
Darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small


But I see your true colours
Shining through
I see your true colours
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colours
True colours
Beautiful


Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy
Can't remember when
I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there


And I'll see your true colours
Shining through
I see your true colours
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colours
True colours are beautiful
